# Tusken - a Lightweight RTOS Simulator in C++

### Overview
"Tusken" is a C++ simulation of some of the core functionalities of a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). This includes task scheduling, simulated peripherals like UART/timer, etc. in a software-only environment. <br/>

Oh, and in case you were wondering, the project is named after the [Star Wars character](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tusken_Raider). <br/>

### To Do:
üóπ Simple cooperative scheduler implementation <br/>
‚òê Upgrade to pre-emptive scheduling <br/>
‚òê IPC + Synchronization <br/>
‚òê Simulated peripherals (UART/timers) <br/>
